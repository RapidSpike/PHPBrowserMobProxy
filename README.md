# PHP BrowserMobProxy API Client

This is a PHP wrapper for the [BrowserMob Proxy](https://github.com/lightbody/browsermob-proxy).

Its forked from [chartjes/PHPBrowserMobProxy](https://github.com/chartjes/PHPBrowserMobProxy) and updated with PHP7 type casting and added the ability to send query strings to the `open()` function.

## Installation

Recommended installation is via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/rapidspike/rapidspike-api-wrapper-php). Check the available version tags, however, development won't be overly active due to to nature of the package.

```
composer require rapidspike/php-browsermob-proxy
```
